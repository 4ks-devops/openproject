  A View is a representation of some information. That information might be a query (currently it always is).
  The view will store the configuration on how to display the information but not the information itself.
  
  A View might then be a graph, a table, a gantt chart or something completely different.
  The client will have to choose how to represenent in the view. 
  
  A View instance will always be of a subtype of `View`, e.g. `View::List`. The properties between each `View` type might differ a lot.
  
  **The View is a new concept so it is prone to change.**
