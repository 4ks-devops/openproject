  A QueryProjection Schema describes the various types of QueryProjections available. There is no `QueryProject` type in itself
  but only subtypes of it e.g. `QueryProjection::Table` and `QueryProjection::Gantt`. 
  Each subtype has properties of it's own so asside from the `_type` property, the other properties will be different from
  subtype to subtype.
