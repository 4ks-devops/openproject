    - name: filters

        JSON specifying filter conditions.

        Accepts the same format as returned by the [queries](https://www.openproject.org/docs/api/endpoints/queries/)
        endpoint. Currently supported filters are:

        + interval: the inclusive date interval to scope non-working days to
          look up. When unspecified, default is from the beginning of current
          month to the end of following month.

          Example: `{ "interval": { "operator": "<>d", "values": ["2022-05-02","2022-05-26"] } }`
          would return non-working days between May 5 and May 26 2022, inclusive.

        + type: the type of non-working days to return. Can have the values
          `NonWorkDay` and `WeekDay`. When unspecified, default is
          `["NonWorkingDay", "WeekDay"]`

          Example: `{ "type": { "operator": "=", "values": ["NonWorkingDay"] } }`
          would return registered non working days only.
      example: '[{ "interval": { "operator": "<>d", "values": ["2022-05-02","2022-05-26"] } }, { "type": { "operator": "=", "values": ["NonWorkingDay"] } }]'
