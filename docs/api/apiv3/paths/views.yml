        JSON specifying filter conditions.
        Currently supported filters are:

        + project: filters views by the project their associated query is assigned to. If the project filter is passed with the `!*` (not any) operator, global views are returned.

        + id: filters views based on their id

        + type: filters views based on their type
      example: '[{ "project_id": { "operator": "!*", "values": null }" }]'

    When calling this endpoint the client provides a single object, containing at least the properties and links that are required, in the body.
    The required fields of a View can be found in its schema, which is embedded in the respective form.
