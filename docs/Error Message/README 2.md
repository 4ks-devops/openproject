## Frequent errors

### Error message: "The resource could not be updated due to parallel access. Click here to update the resource to the latest version."

This error usually occurs if the work package was edited in the meantime before it was updated again at your end. 

### I'm not able to open the drop down menu to change the status of a work package. Is there something I missed?

It looks like you created some custom status types under Manage work package [status](.../.../system-admin-guide/manage-work-packages/work-package-status/) Once you do that, these statuses must be activated in specific workflows. Double check your workflows [here](.../.../system-admin-guide/manage-work-packages/work-package-workflows/). 
Important: Make sure to uncheck “Only display statuses that are used by this type” when editing the workflows under Administration -> Workflow so you can see all of them. Then you can map them.
